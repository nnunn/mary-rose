    <p> I didn't want to have to look at my sad sorry face anymore.  I'd look in the mirror and see my eyes and I just wanted to rip them out of my head and stomp on them.</p>
    <p>From here it all looks so unneeded - all that guilt, all that punishing myself over and over and sinking down under the weight of my broken heart. It didn't have to be like that.<br/><br/>But the only way I felt like I could escape the boat I was in was to jump overboard.</p>
